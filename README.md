# Project Abstract
The goal of this research was to identify locations in the genome of the keeled treehopper (Entylia carinata), that are associated with specific phenotypes in the species. Treehoppers are phytophagous insects and are shown to feed, reproduce, and rear their young on specific aster species. The insects have been observed selectively breeding with treehoppers from the same plant species as themselves, suggesting possible genetic separation in the species based on plant nativity. Machine learning was chosen for analysis due to its ability to identify obscure patterns and inferences in data. A random forest classification model was tuned and trained on sampled treehopper genetic data to predict the type of plant that the samples originated from. The model displayed strong predictive capabilities and its feature importances were extracted for further evaluation. A backwards purging technique was used to identify a subset of loci deemed predictive of the phenotype.
